### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned how to effectively use Svelte for building dynamic user interfaces. I also improved my skills in creating responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS. One of the key takeaways was understanding how to manage state in Svelte and how to bind data to the UI seamlessly.
I also got to practice writing clean and maintainable code, which is crucial for any frontend development project. Here are some code snippets that I'm particularly proud of:

### Continued development

I plan to continue developing my skills in Svelte and Tailwind CSS. I want to explore more advanced features of Svelte, such as stores and context API, to build more complex applications. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of responsive design principles and how to implement them effectively using Tailwind CSS.
